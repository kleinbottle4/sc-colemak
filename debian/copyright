This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the public domain
spread sheet sc, posted several years ago by Mark Weiser as vc,
originally by James Gosling.

This package was originally put together by 
Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>, and later adopted by 
Chad Miller <cmiller@debian.org>.  Source was obtained from:
  http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/financial/spreadsheet/sc-7.13.tar.gz

Sc is not a product of ProsLink, Inc.  It is supplied as is with no
warranty, express or implied, as a service to Usenet readers.  It is
not copyrighted, either.  Have at it.

Some of the files were originally written by Robert Bond, James
Gosling, Bradley Williams or Mark Nagel.
